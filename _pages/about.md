# About Me

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the University of Queensland, supervised by A/Prof. <a href="https://baigd.github.io/">Guangdong Bai</a> and Dr. <a href="https://people.csiro.au/x/j/jason-xue">Jason Xue</a>. My research focuses on tackling real-world security & privacy issues, especially on building trustworthy AI and designing privacy-preserving systems. 

# Research Interests

<ul>
  <li>Trustworthy AI</li>
  <li>Safety of Multimodal Models and Large Language Models</li>
  <li>NSFW Content Generation and Mitigation</li>
  <li>Privacy-Preserving on Purpose Limitation Principle</li>
</ul>
